		<p>I think this blog will most probably become a daydream diary. Oh wellz, let’s talk about random ideas. Today I was daydreaming during my calculus class (this is one of the reasons I suck at calculus, more on that in another post) and thought something really cool.</p>

<p>Now, this is kind of completely out of my field so I don’t know how feasible or useful it might be but, I was thinking that cellphones spend most of their lives on standby and these phones have CPUs which we could use to do something useful, so how about we use them to help solve problems.</p>

<p>I was thinking of something along the lines of wolframalpha, solving via cluster of CPUs. We could connect a bunch of phones via an app running in the background which would receive requests to do some processing. These requests would be problems that can be broken up into smaller pieces.These pieces would be sent all around to phones to be solved and then be sent back to a server coordinating the problem solving.</p>

<p>You could also have the server look for phones with more powerful CPUs to solve more difficult parts of the problem, which might not be as easily broken down.</p>

		<p>Hello world! It’s that time of the year again where I am forced to do a little house keeping. My blog has been incredibly hideous for a couple of months now and I finally got the opportunity to do somethign about it.</p>

<p>I’ve redesigned it and, since apparently I am terrible at designing stuff I went with a very minimalistic approach. So my new blog is easier on the eyes, simpler and, will now become my homepage.</p>

<p>There isn’t much to it, I’ll be moving a couple of my old posts over to the new blog and I’ll do my best to start blogging at least twice a week. It’s actually harder said than done</p>

<p>The blog runs on Jekyll now, mostly because it is hacker friendlier than tumblr and I love the idea of version controlled blogging. I will also remove comments from the blog since they distract me quite often. If anyone feels the need to tell me anything they are free to email me.</p>

		<p>Ok, so what&#8217;s up dear readers? I&#8217;ve been up to a bunch of random things lately so I&#8217;ll write them down just so I know what I was up to at this time of year later on.</p>
<p>First of all, I got a new job. I guess I&#8217;ll stop freelancing for the time being and focus on my new (awesome) job. Starting 2 weeks ago, I&#8217;ll be working as a &#8220;Graphic Developer&#8221; for the HNSC, which, is a fancy way to say I am a front end developer. I get to play with lots of javascript and are surrounded by amazing people I didn&#8217;t even know about! So yes, lots of new people and cool projects which might actually inspire me to build new and cool things on my own.</p>
<p>Second, I&#8217;ve been getting into javascript a lot lately. Like a serious lot. Even before my new job, I started reading and developing almost exclusively in javascript. I feel like I&#8217;ve been improving a lot constantly these past couple of weeks and am really happy about it. I&#8217;ve read and develop a lot, trying to get my vanilla javascript up to speed and I&#8217;ve been working with a lot of jQuery at work as well so that&#8217;s that. Today I built a jQuery plugin which, doesn&#8217;t do much but it&#8217;s exactly what I needed I&#8217;ll talk more about it once I figure out if I can release it as open source. That&#8217;ll hopefully happen soon.</p>
<p>Third, since I recently started working as a frontend developer, which is almost completely opposite from my old freelancing stuff where I focused on the backend, I decided to start a pears repository of stuff I use often just to keep mental notes and to share with you guys. You can find them here: <a href="http://patterns.martianwabbit.com/">http://patterns.martianwabbit.com/</a></p>
<p>And I guess that&#8217;s basically it, school is as hard as usual, I am still pretty dumb and I get paid to program for 4 hours on a daily basis, I am doing pretty good these days.</p>

		<p><em>This is probably one of the coolest things I&#8217;ve worked on in a while and I also happen to have time to write a blog post about it, which is great, I love working with hardware from time to time.</em></p>
<p>It definitely isn&#8217;t the biggest programming challenge I&#8217;ve had but it is pretty cool and I am certain others might find it interesting. Yesterday, I was helping my sister with a project she was doing for her professional practice (she is a very weird kind of engineer who specializes in automation stuff, she is great at it), she was basically asked to open a door with a RFID card.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4r3qapJDn1qazvm1.jpg"/></p>
<p>To do this, she had a very simple plan, we plug an RFID card reader into a computer which then sends the RFID over to a computer and then tells an Arduino to open the door. She used this <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8628">RFID Reader</a> (RFID Reader ID-20 (125&#160;kHz)) which is pretty inexpensive and easy to plug into a computer.</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4r3roDKpw1qazvm1.jpg"/></p>
<p>This was fairly straight-forward for her, she mounted the RFID card reader into a board and plugged it into her computer along with her Arduino. She then fired up putty and set it to read the RFID card reader&#8217;s serial port (COM 9, in our case) which showed us the RFID of any card we read. </p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4r3qluG5S1qazvm1.jpg"/></p>
<p>This is where I came in, she isn&#8217;t that much of a coder so she asked me for help on how to finish the connection between the RFID reader and the Arduino. This is what I came up in Ruby:</p>

<pre>
<code data-language="ruby">
require "serialport"
 
@rfid_reader = SerialPort.new 4 # Open COM 5
@arduino = SerialPort.new 2 # Open COM 3
 
@valid_ids = ['4500B8D690BB']
 
def readRFID
  rfid = @rfid_reader.gets
  rfid.strip!
  rfid.slice(0) if rfid.size == 13
  rfid.slice(0..1) if rfid.size == 14
 
  return rfid
end
 
puts "Waiting for input..."
loop do
  rfid = readRFID # Get the RFID of the current card
  if !rfid.empty? 
    if @valid_ids.include? rfid # is the ID valid?
      puts "RFID: " + rfid
 
      # Send the arduino a signal so it opens the lock.
      @arduino.write "1" 
    else
      puts "Invalid RFID: " + rfid
      @arduino.write ""
    end
  end
  @arduino.write ""
end
</code>
</pre>

<p>
	I was actually going to use C++ but, I prefer using Ruby whenever possible. This is a very simple code snippet but it did the job wonderfully. The code is documented and very simple, I used the fabulous <a href="https://github.com/hparra/ruby-serialport">ruby-serialport</a> gem which, took care of all the heavy lifting for me.
</p>

<p>
	This was only half of the work though, we also needed to get the Arduino to wait for an input coming from the computer and do something whenever a value is received, in this case we wanted to open a lock so that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll do.
</p>

<pre>
<code data-language="c">
void setup () {
  Serial.begin (9600);
  pinMode (12, OUTPUT);
}
 
void serialEvent() {
  digitalWrite(12, HIGH);
  delay(2000);
  digitalWrite(12, LOW);
  Serial.read();
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>
	The code is even simpler than the Ruby one running on the computer. All it does is wait for there to be an input and then activate a pin when there is one. Ruby is pretty much doing all of the actual processing and telling the Arduino when and what to do.
</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m4r3s7jnwp1qazvm1.png"/></p>
<p>Finally, all we had to do was fire up the terminal and run our Ruby program which would then wait for there to be an input form the RFID reader. Whenever there&#8217;s an input it&#8217;ll log it and then, if the RFID is registered, tell the Arduino to open the lock. And that&#8217;s basically it, it made a nice problem to solve for fun.</p>

		<p><span>So for some mysterious and unknown reason I am selling a windows markdown editor. It’s called Mew, and you can get it for $8 at </span><a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/mew-windows-markdown-editor/924879">codecanyon</a><span>.</span></p>
<p>Mew, as you’d expect from a markdown editor is pretty simple. I built it for myself using C# and the awesome .net framework. I was basically forced into building it since, there wasn&#8217;t a nice markdown editor for windows available. I worked on polishing it for a couple of weeks and now here the end result:</p>
<p><a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/mew-windows-markdown-editor/924879"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvp53kpOSQ1qazvm1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It has built-in snippets, color themes and a live-preview, among other things.</p>
<p>I am fairly happy with the results. It provides a simple, yet customizable enviorment, it’s fast and really simple. I’ve tried to create an editor that doesn’t get in your way and that actually tries to help you. It was built for my needs so, these are addressed completely. I might add more features in future versions if anyone requests them since, I want it to be good editor for everyone.</p>
<p>I have a small list of things I’ve been considering to add so, we’ll see how that ends up working. Hopefully I’ll get somewhere with it and, even if it’s not a good seller, I did enjoy building it, working with C# is entertaining and pretty cool so, it made the whole process a nice experience. If I don&#8217;t make a single sale for a couple of months I&#8217;ll open-source it since, it&#8217;d mean there&#8217;s no commercial potential for it.</p>
