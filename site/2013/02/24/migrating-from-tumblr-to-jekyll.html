	<p>A couple of months ago I moved my blog from Tumblr over to Jekyll and started hosting it with Webfaction. 
It&#39;s been great so far but, I never quite figured out how to get rid of my old url redirecting everything to it&#39;s new 
page on the new blog. </p>

<p>I originally thought I&#39;d have to write a redirect rule for each of the posts I kept on the new blog and then make the 
subdomain redirect to to the domain. Needless to say that it felt so annoying that I ended up not doing anything at all.
Until now, that is. So here is how I fixed stuff! First of all, since I imported my Tumblr posts using the importer that 
comes with Jekyll, I had urls that looked like this: </p>

<p><code>
    http://martianwabbit.com/2011/04/04/4344642365.html
</code></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t really change them, I thought that they having their old ID would be handy when I wanted to make the shift 
completely. This ended up being a good decision at the end.</p>

<p>So now, the only thing I needed to do was to redirect this:</p>

<p><code>
http://blog.martianwabbit.com/post/4344642365/justvector-social-icons-font
</code></p>

<p>to this:</p>

<p><code>
http://martianwabbit.com/2011/04/04/4344642365.html
</code></p>

<p>Which isn&#39;t as straight-forward since, I have no way of knowing what the date might be, so I changed the permalink 
for imported posts to this:</p>

<p><code>
<pre>
--- <br>
layout: post <br>
title: &quot;JustVector Social Icons Font&quot; <br></p>

<h2>permalink: /post/4344642365.html <br></h2>

<p></pre>
</code></p>

<p>So I could just do a simple URL redirect. Now, all I needed to do was setup apache so it&#39;d redirect the URLs as intended,
that was probably the easiest part, a quick regex later I ended up with this:</p>

<p><code>
<pre>
RedirectMatch \/post\/([0-9]+)\/.* /post/$1.html
</pre>
</code></p>

<p>Which worked exactly as intended, now all I have to do, is wait for the DNS to finish propagating.</p>
