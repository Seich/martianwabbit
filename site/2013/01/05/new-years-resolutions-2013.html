	<time>January 05, 2013</time>
	<p>I&#8217;ll begin by saying this will be a great year. I have a lot of objectives and things I want to accomplish. Some will be the culmination of past efforts and some are new things I want to get done. My first resolution is to blog more. I&#8217;ve been saying I&#8217;ll start blogging more often for a couple of years now and I keep failing. I&#8217;ll change that and thus, my first objective is to write 52 posts this year, one per week. Since I don&#8217;t alway have too much time I am not requiring myself to publish every week as long as I get it done eventually. I also will write small random stuff most of the time since, that&#8217;s how I roll.</p>

<p>My second resolution is to start a company. I am currently participating in contest sponsored by my university. If I were to win I&#8217;d be established as a company in a couple of months. Even if this doesn&#8217;t work out, I&#8217;ll get started on my own.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s more development and learning to be done in 2013 as well. I&#8217;d say 2012 was the year of Javascript. Working as a front-end developer forces you to learn a lot of Javascript so it&#8217;s been a great experience. This year I&#8217;ll further evolve as a Javascript developer but, I also want to master ruby. I just love that language and even though I&#8217;ve worked with it a lot I don&#8217;t feel as confident in my skills. It still feels too magical for my taste. I&#8217;ll be working a lot more on personal projects (and blogging about it as well). I already have one android app in mind and a couple of gems to make my life easier.</p>

<p>In the end I hope this year is as great as the last one and I learn, develop and grow a lot more.</p>
