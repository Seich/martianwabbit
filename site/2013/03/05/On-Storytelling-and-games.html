	<p>I think we live in a very exciting time. We have so many incredible things to communicate and so many mediums to do so. I&#8217;ve always been a daydreamer. I remember my third grade teacher using me in an example when he introduced the word. It always stuck with me, I am pretty introverted sometimes and, allowing myself to live in a different superposed world has always kept me sane.</p>

<p>All these years I&#8217;ve been developing a world in my head, all the fine details, all the characters that inhabit such a world and every single one of their motivations and dreams have been slowly built and polish as my life goes on. I&#8217;ve thought of writing a book for years. Not because I want to be a writer, I&#8217;ll always be a programmer, but because I want to capture this world. I don&#8217;t want to lose it and I want others who know me and have heard all my stories to understand how deep this rabbit hole is.</p>

<p>The problem is, I am not a writer (and as I said before, I don&#8217;t want to be one) so, writing a book is pretty daunting. Luckily there are many other mediums available to me, even though I love all sort of media, my favorite one, and the one that incorporates every other media I like is video games. I&#8217;ve always wanted to become an indie game developer. So far I haven&#8217;t been successful mostly because I let other parts of my life get in the way. I plan to change that though.</p>

<p>I want to use video games as a canvas on which I tell my stories. I think it&#8217;s probably the only way for them to be as immersing for everyone as they&#8217;ve been for me. From now on, I&#8217;ll start working on games that tell all of my daydreams. I&#8217;ve already started on the first one, the genre will be a huge mash-up of elements I like and will hopefully get my message through. Video games are truly the means to greater expression right now and I want to fully embrace that.</p>
