  I am probably the most bored person I know. What I mean by this is, that I am almost never entertained. Most of the time, I&#8217;ll be doing something for some 5 minutes before my short attention span takes me elsewhere. This has stopped me from finishing a lot of personal projects in the past, losing a lot of cool things I built halfway through. 
</p>

<p>
  Since, I almost never finish my projects, I&#8217;ve decided to start publishing them. Hopefully, just knowing that others are looking at my code my motivate me to continue developing something. I&#8217;ve finally started using <a title="My Github Account" href="https://github.com/Seich">my Github account</a> to it&#8217;s fullest. I honestly doubt it&#8217;ll actually have a great effect on me but, any motivation I might get will prove useful. So, in conclusion, I&#8217;ll be releasing most of the stuff I do whenever I am bored on my Github account and I&#8217;ll be posting about it here, all in an attempt to keep me interested.

<h2>Introducing PHP Routs</h2>

<p>
  Let&#8217;s move on to my actual project. <a title="PHP Routs" href="http://routs.martianwabbit.com">Routs</a>, is a small PHP library built to handle URLs. Some background: I was playing with <a title="Ruby's Sinatra" href="htttp://www.sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a> the other day and, just by reading the documentation I fell in love with how it managed URL routes (I later discovered I wasn&#8217;t the only since, there are a bunch of projects written in PHP following it&#8217;s example). So, I decided I wanted to do the same in PHP but, in a very simple way which, would allow me to easily implement it into any project by including a single file.
</p>

<p>
  It turned out to be a lot easier than I expected. After deciding on the syntax I would like to use with plugin I made huge advances in just a couple of lines. This is what I have so far:
</p>

<p>
  Let&#8217;s say I am building an simple one page site for some guy named Bob. Since it&#8217;s so simple, I want to have as much as I can in a single page. Routs allow me to do something like this:
</p>

<pre>
<code data-language="php">
require 'routs.php';

Rout::get('home', 'homeFunction');

function homeFunction($params) {
  templateManager::Render('home.tpl', $params);
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>
  In this example I am using Routs to handle all get requests to example.com/home using the homeFunction() function. The part about the template manager is whatever method you&#8217;re using, I&#8217;ll be creating my own soonish. Now, I added a form to my html page and I want it to be handled on the same page. My routs handler changes into this:
</p>

<pre>
<code data-language="php">
require 'routs.php';

Rout::get('home', 'homeFunction');

function homeFunction($params) {
  templateManager::Render('home.tpl', $params);
}

Rout::post('home', function($params){
  mail(
    'seich@martianwabbit.awesome', 
    'Some Subject', 
    emailHandler::Render('mailTemplate.tpl', $params)
  );
});
</code>
</pre>

<p>
  Which handles the the submitted form and so on. Basically, the possibilities are endless! :D So yeah, that&#8217;s it, have fun with it, fork it, tell me why it sucks, etc.
