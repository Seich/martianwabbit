		<p><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com">Foundation</a> is great. I love it, I use it whenever I am building anything big. My favorite feature and the one key thing that has kept me as a fan for so long has been it's grid. I feel like it's the best grid we have available so far.</p>

<p>
    My favorite thing about that grid you ask? Apart from just being plainly awesome? Well, it's the semantic option. I know you probably haven't put much thought into it but, don't you feel like grid classes tend to clutter the html? I do, and I hate it. Enter the mixins!
</p>

<h2>The Mixins</h2>
<p>
    To alleviate this issue, Foundation gives us a set of really handy mixins which allow you to build a really semantic grid. It's as flexible as it can be and just as easy to use (I'd argue that if you're familiar with sass, it's just plainly easier and requires less typing).
</p>

<p>To demonstrate, I'll be showing you how to build this:</p>
<div>
    <img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/08411t3C1f393p3W2B0G/Screen%20Shot%202013-10-11%20at%2012.45.18%20PM.png" alt="Demo">
</div>

<p>As you can see, it's a very simple layout. It'd be really easy to build it using the grid classes, it's even easier to build it using the mixins. Here's my markup:</p>
<pre>
<code data-language="html">&lt;article&gt;
  &lt;header&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
  
  &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;img src=&quot;http://lorempixel.com/300/400/&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Exercitationem, voluptatibus, deserunt, facilis iusto sapiente impedit praesentium laudantium minus voluptas numquam incidunt corrupti sequi laboriosam magnam officia perspiciatis quas quam quaerat!
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<p>As you can see it's pretty standard except the elements lack classes and such. Much prettier than usual in my opinion.</p>

<p>Here's my CSS:</p>

<pre>
<code data-language="css">@import "foundation/components/global";
@import "foundation/components/grid";

$total-columns: 5;
article {
  @include grid-row;

  header {
    @include grid-row;

    h1 {
      @include grid-column(5);  
    }
  }

  div {
    @include grid-column(2);
  }

  p {
    @include grid-column(3);
  }
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Awesome, right? Here I am the grid-column and grid-row mixins to create the grid directly in my CSS. All you have to do is import the mixins. There are also many options to customize the grid, in this case I changed the number of columns from the default 12, to 5. I am also nesting rows, all from the CSS, leaving the HTML to describe it's thing. </p>

<h3>Side note:</h3>
<p>I hadn't notice that in this case you're putting a row directly inside another row, this isn't ideal as it can cause alignment issues. Ideally you'd have the header inside full width column to prevent this. I don't think it matters in this example but in anything more complex it might be a pain to debug.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/smiley">@smiley</a> for the heads up!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I feel like this technique is a great way to simplify the HTML and further decouple it from it's CSS. They've been several similar things before such as the <a href="http://semantic.gs/">Semantic Grid</a> which experimented with this idea. Foundation has a much more powerful grid so, it being able to work this way as well makes me really happy.</p>

	So here's a really quick tip, when you run a RethinkDB instance on a remote server you cannot access the admin interface, by default, from the outside of the server. The easiest way to get around this without allowing anyone to access it is to use a ssh tunnel like this:
</p>

<pre>
	<code data-language="shell">
$ ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 &lt;host&gt;
	</code>
</pre>

<p>
	This basically uses ssh to map the port 8080 of your machine (127.0.0.1 or localhost) to the port 8080 on the host machine. Don't forget to replace "&lt;host&gt;" with your actual remote host.
</p>

<p>
	With this, you can now connect to the admin interface by going to localhost:8080 on your machine. Note that this will only work as long as the ssh connection remains open.
</p>

<code data-language='javascript'>
var countries = ["Afghanistan", "Åland Islands", "Albania", "Algeria", "American Samoa", "Andorra", "Angola", "Anguilla", "Antarctica", "Antigua And Barbuda", "Argentina", "Armenia", "Aruba", "Australia", "Austria", "Azerbaijan", "Bahamas", "Bahrain", "Bangladesh", "Barbados", "Belarus", "Belgium", "Belize", "Benin", "Bermuda", "Bhutan", "Bolivia, Plurinational State Of", "Bonaire, Sint Eustatius And Saba", "Bosnia And Herzegovina", "Botswana", "Bouvet Island", "Brazil", "British Indian Ocean Territory", "Brunei Darussalam", "Bulgaria", "Burkina Faso", "Burundi", "Cambodia", "Cameroon", "Canada", "Cape Verde", "Cayman Islands", "Central African Republic", "Chad", "Chile", "China", "Christmas Island", "Cocos (keeling) Islands", "Colombia", "Comoros", "Congo", "Congo, The Democratic Republic Of The", "Cook Islands", "Costa Rica", "Côte D'ivoire", "Croatia", "Cuba", "Curaçao", "Cyprus", "Czech Republic", "Denmark", "Djibouti", "Dominica", "Dominican Republic", "Ecuador", "Egypt", "El Salvador", "Equatorial Guinea", "Eritrea", "Estonia", "Ethiopia", "Falkland Islands (malvinas)", "Faroe Islands", "Fiji", "Finland", "France", "French Guiana", "French Polynesia", "French Southern Territories", "Gabon", "Gambia", "Georgia", "Germany", "Ghana", "Gibraltar", "Greece", "Greenland", "Grenada", "Guadeloupe", "Guam", "Guatemala", "Guernsey", "Guinea", "Guinea-bissau", "Guyana", "Haiti", "Heard Island And Mcdonald Islands", "Holy See (vatican City State)", "Honduras", "Hong Kong", "Hungary", "Iceland", "India", "Indonesia", "Iran, Islamic Republic Of", "Iraq", "Ireland", "Isle Of Man", "Israel", "Italy", "Jamaica", "Japan", "Jersey", "Jordan", "Kazakhstan", "Kenya", "Kiribati", "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of", "Korea, Republic Of", "Kuwait", "Kyrgyzstan", "Lao People's Democratic Republic", "Latvia", "Lebanon", "Lesotho", "Liberia", "Libya", "Liechtenstein", "Lithuania", "Luxembourg", "Macao", "Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic Of", "Madagascar", "Malawi", "Malaysia", "Maldives", "Mali", "Malta", "Marshall Islands", "Martinique", "Mauritania", "Mauritius", "Mayotte", "Mexico", "Micronesia, Federated States Of", "Moldova, Republic Of", "Monaco", "Mongolia", "Montenegro", "Montserrat", "Morocco", "Mozambique", "Myanmar", "Namibia", "Nauru", "Nepal", "Netherlands", "New Caledonia", "New Zealand", "Nicaragua", "Niger", "Nigeria", "Niue", "Norfolk Island", "Northern Mariana Islands", "Norway", "Oman", "Pakistan", "Palau", "Palestine, State Of", "Panama", "Papua New Guinea", "Paraguay", "Peru", "Philippines", "Pitcairn", "Poland", "Portugal", "Puerto Rico", "Qatar", "Réunion", "Romania", "Russian Federation", "Rwanda", "Saint Barthélemy", "Saint Helena, Ascension And Tristan Da Cunha", "Saint Kitts And Nevis", "Saint Lucia", "Saint Martin (french Part)", "Saint Pierre And Miquelon", "Saint Vincent And The Grenadines", "Samoa", "San Marino", "Sao Tome And Principe", "Saudi Arabia", "Senegal", "Serbia", "Seychelles", "Sierra Leone", "Singapore", "Sint Maarten (dutch Part)", "Slovakia", "Slovenia", "Solomon Islands", "Somalia", "South Africa", "South Georgia And The South Sandwich Islands", "South Sudan", "Spain", "Sri Lanka", "Sudan", "Suriname", "Svalbard And Jan Mayen", "Swaziland", "Sweden", "Switzerland", "Syrian Arab Republic", "Taiwan, Province Of China", "Tajikistan", "Tanzania, United Republic Of", "Thailand", "Timor-leste", "Togo", "Tokelau", "Tonga", "Trinidad And Tobago", "Tunisia", "Turkey", "Turkmenistan", "Turks And Caicos Islands", "Tuvalu", "Uganda", "Ukraine", "United Arab Emirates", "United Kingdom", "United States", "United States Minor Outlying Islands", "Uruguay", "Uzbekistan", "Vanuatu", "Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic Of", "Viet Nam", "Virgin Islands, British", "Virgin Islands, U.s.", "Wallis And Futuna", "Western Sahara", "Yemen", "Zambia", "Zimbabwe"];

<p>It follows the ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 standard. You don’t need an array with countries everyday but, when you do, getting it is a pain. I am putting it here so my future self doesn’t have to look for it again.</p>

<p>Here’s how I got the list:</p>
<pre>
<code data-language='javascript'>
$ = jQuery;
String.prototype.capitalize = function() {
    return this.replace(/(?:^|\s)\S/g, function(a) { return a.toUpperCase(); });
};

var countries = "var countries = [";

$('tbody').find("tr").each(function(i) {
    var country = $(this).find('td').last().text();
    country = country.toLowerCase().capitalize();
    if (i === 0) {
        countries = countries + "\"" + country + "\"";
    } else {
        countries = countries + ", " + "\"" + country + "\"";
    }
});

countries = countries + "];";
console.log(countries);
</code>
</pre>
<p>If you run that script in <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/iso_3166_code_lists/country_names_and_code_elements.htm">here</a>, you’ll get a nice string printed on the console which you can copy and paste and use as an array. Quick 5-minute hack FTW.</p>

		<p>I think we live in a very exciting time. We have so many incredible things to communicate and so many mediums to do so. I’ve always been a daydreamer. I remember my third grade teacher using me in an example when he introduced the word. It always stuck with me, I am pretty introverted sometimes and, allowing myself to live in a different superposed world has always kept me sane.</p>

<p>All these years I’ve been developing a world in my head, all the fine details, all the characters that inhabit such a world and every single one of their motivations and dreams have been slowly built and polish as my life goes on. I’ve thought of writing a book for years. Not because I want to be a writer, I’ll always be a programmer, but because I want to capture this world. I don’t want to lose it and I want others who know me and have heard all my stories to understand how deep this rabbit hole is.</p>

<p>The problem is, I am not a writer (and as I said before, I don’t want to be one) so, writing a book is pretty daunting. Luckily there are many other mediums available to me, even though I love all sort of media, my favorite one, and the one that incorporates every other media I like is video games. I’ve always wanted to become an indie game developer. So far I haven’t been successful mostly because I let other parts of my life get in the way. I plan to change that though.</p>

<p>I want to use video games as a canvas on which I tell my stories. I think it’s probably the only way for them to be as immersing for everyone as they’ve been for me. From now on, I’ll start working on games that tell all of my daydreams. I’ve already started on the first one, the genre will be a huge mash-up of elements I like and will hopefully get my message through. Video games are truly the means to greater expression right now and I want to fully embrace that.</p>

		<p>A couple of months ago I moved my blog from Tumblr over to Jekyll and started hosting it with Webfaction. It’s been great so far but, I never quite figured out how to get rid of my old url redirecting everything to it’s new page on the new blog.</p>

<p>I originally thought I’d have to write a redirect rule for each of the posts I kept on the new blog and then make the subdomain redirect to to the domain. Needless to say that it felt so annoying that I ended up not doing anything at all. Until now, that is. So here is how I fixed stuff! First of all, since I imported my Tumblr posts using the importer that comes with Jekyll, I had urls that looked like this:</p>

<p><code>
	http://martianwabbit.com/2011/04/04/4344642365.html
</code></p>

<p>I didn’t really change them, I thought that they having their old ID would be handy when I wanted to make the shift completely. This ended up being a good decision at the end.</p>

<p>So now, the only thing I needed to do was to redirect this:</p>

<p><code>
http://blog.martianwabbit.com/post/4344642365/justvector-social-icons-font
</code></p>

<p>to this:</p>

<p><code>
http://martianwabbit.com/2011/04/04/4344642365.html
</code></p>

<p>Which isn’t as straight-forward since, I have no way of knowing what the date might be, so I changed the permalink for imported posts to this:</p>

<p><code>
<pre>
— <br />
layout: post <br />
title: &quot;JustVector Social Icons Font&quot; <br />
permalink: /post/4344642365.html <br />
—
</pre>
</code></p>

<p>So I could just do a simple URL redirect. Now, all I needed to do was setup apache so it’d redirect the URLs as intended, that was probably the easiest part, a quick regex later I ended up with this:</p>

<p><code>
<pre>
RedirectMatch \/post\/([0-9]+)\/.* /post/$1.html
</pre>
</code></p>

<p>Which worked exactly as intended, now all I have to do, is wait for the DNS to finish propagating.</p>
