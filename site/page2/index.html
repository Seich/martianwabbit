<pre>
<code data-language='javascript'>
var countries = ["Afghanistan", "Åland Islands", "Albania", "Algeria", "American Samoa", "Andorra", "Angola", "Anguilla", "Antarctica", "Antigua And Barbuda", "Argentina", "Armenia", "Aruba", "Australia", "Austria", "Azerbaijan", "Bahamas", "Bahrain", "Bangladesh", "Barbados", "Belarus", "Belgium", "Belize", "Benin", "Bermuda", "Bhutan", "Bolivia, Plurinational State Of", "Bonaire, Sint Eustatius And Saba", "Bosnia And Herzegovina", "Botswana", "Bouvet Island", "Brazil", "British Indian Ocean Territory", "Brunei Darussalam", "Bulgaria", "Burkina Faso", "Burundi", "Cambodia", "Cameroon", "Canada", "Cape Verde", "Cayman Islands", "Central African Republic", "Chad", "Chile", "China", "Christmas Island", "Cocos (keeling) Islands", "Colombia", "Comoros", "Congo", "Congo, The Democratic Republic Of The", "Cook Islands", "Costa Rica", "Côte D'ivoire", "Croatia", "Cuba", "Curaçao", "Cyprus", "Czech Republic", "Denmark", "Djibouti", "Dominica", "Dominican Republic", "Ecuador", "Egypt", "El Salvador", "Equatorial Guinea", "Eritrea", "Estonia", "Ethiopia", "Falkland Islands (malvinas)", "Faroe Islands", "Fiji", "Finland", "France", "French Guiana", "French Polynesia", "French Southern Territories", "Gabon", "Gambia", "Georgia", "Germany", "Ghana", "Gibraltar", "Greece", "Greenland", "Grenada", "Guadeloupe", "Guam", "Guatemala", "Guernsey", "Guinea", "Guinea-bissau", "Guyana", "Haiti", "Heard Island And Mcdonald Islands", "Holy See (vatican City State)", "Honduras", "Hong Kong", "Hungary", "Iceland", "India", "Indonesia", "Iran, Islamic Republic Of", "Iraq", "Ireland", "Isle Of Man", "Israel", "Italy", "Jamaica", "Japan", "Jersey", "Jordan", "Kazakhstan", "Kenya", "Kiribati", "Korea, Democratic People's Republic Of", "Korea, Republic Of", "Kuwait", "Kyrgyzstan", "Lao People's Democratic Republic", "Latvia", "Lebanon", "Lesotho", "Liberia", "Libya", "Liechtenstein", "Lithuania", "Luxembourg", "Macao", "Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic Of", "Madagascar", "Malawi", "Malaysia", "Maldives", "Mali", "Malta", "Marshall Islands", "Martinique", "Mauritania", "Mauritius", "Mayotte", "Mexico", "Micronesia, Federated States Of", "Moldova, Republic Of", "Monaco", "Mongolia", "Montenegro", "Montserrat", "Morocco", "Mozambique", "Myanmar", "Namibia", "Nauru", "Nepal", "Netherlands", "New Caledonia", "New Zealand", "Nicaragua", "Niger", "Nigeria", "Niue", "Norfolk Island", "Northern Mariana Islands", "Norway", "Oman", "Pakistan", "Palau", "Palestine, State Of", "Panama", "Papua New Guinea", "Paraguay", "Peru", "Philippines", "Pitcairn", "Poland", "Portugal", "Puerto Rico", "Qatar", "Réunion", "Romania", "Russian Federation", "Rwanda", "Saint Barthélemy", "Saint Helena, Ascension And Tristan Da Cunha", "Saint Kitts And Nevis", "Saint Lucia", "Saint Martin (french Part)", "Saint Pierre And Miquelon", "Saint Vincent And The Grenadines", "Samoa", "San Marino", "Sao Tome And Principe", "Saudi Arabia", "Senegal", "Serbia", "Seychelles", "Sierra Leone", "Singapore", "Sint Maarten (dutch Part)", "Slovakia", "Slovenia", "Solomon Islands", "Somalia", "South Africa", "South Georgia And The South Sandwich Islands", "South Sudan", "Spain", "Sri Lanka", "Sudan", "Suriname", "Svalbard And Jan Mayen", "Swaziland", "Sweden", "Switzerland", "Syrian Arab Republic", "Taiwan, Province Of China", "Tajikistan", "Tanzania, United Republic Of", "Thailand", "Timor-leste", "Togo", "Tokelau", "Tonga", "Trinidad And Tobago", "Tunisia", "Turkey", "Turkmenistan", "Turks And Caicos Islands", "Tuvalu", "Uganda", "Ukraine", "United Arab Emirates", "United Kingdom", "United States", "United States Minor Outlying Islands", "Uruguay", "Uzbekistan", "Vanuatu", "Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic Of", "Viet Nam", "Virgin Islands, British", "Virgin Islands, U.s.", "Wallis And Futuna", "Western Sahara", "Yemen", "Zambia", "Zimbabwe"];

<p>It follows the ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 standard. You don’t need an array with countries everyday but, when you do, getting it is a pain. I am putting it here so my future self doesn’t have to look for it again.</p>

<p>Here’s how I got the list:</p>
<pre>
<code data-language='javascript'>
$ = jQuery;
String.prototype.capitalize = function() {
    return this.replace(/(?:^|\s)\S/g, function(a) { return a.toUpperCase(); });
};

var countries = "var countries = [";

$('tbody').find("tr").each(function(i) {
    var country = $(this).find('td').last().text();
    country = country.toLowerCase().capitalize();
    if (i === 0) {
        countries = countries + "\"" + country + "\"";
    } else {
        countries = countries + ", " + "\"" + country + "\"";
    }
});

countries = countries + "];";
console.log(countries);
</code>
</pre>
<p>If you run that script in <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/iso_3166_code_lists/country_names_and_code_elements.htm">here</a>, you’ll get a nice string printed on the console which you can copy and paste and use as an array. Quick 5-minute hack FTW.</p>

		<p>I think we live in a very exciting time. We have so many incredible things to communicate and so many mediums to do so. I’ve always been a daydreamer. I remember my third grade teacher using me in an example when he introduced the word. It always stuck with me, I am pretty introverted sometimes and, allowing myself to live in a different superposed world has always kept me sane.</p>

<p>All these years I’ve been developing a world in my head, all the fine details, all the characters that inhabit such a world and every single one of their motivations and dreams have been slowly built and polish as my life goes on. I’ve thought of writing a book for years. Not because I want to be a writer, I’ll always be a programmer, but because I want to capture this world. I don’t want to lose it and I want others who know me and have heard all my stories to understand how deep this rabbit hole is.</p>

<p>The problem is, I am not a writer (and as I said before, I don’t want to be one) so, writing a book is pretty daunting. Luckily there are many other mediums available to me, even though I love all sort of media, my favorite one, and the one that incorporates every other media I like is video games. I’ve always wanted to become an indie game developer. So far I haven’t been successful mostly because I let other parts of my life get in the way. I plan to change that though.</p>

<p>I want to use video games as a canvas on which I tell my stories. I think it’s probably the only way for them to be as immersing for everyone as they’ve been for me. From now on, I’ll start working on games that tell all of my daydreams. I’ve already started on the first one, the genre will be a huge mash-up of elements I like and will hopefully get my message through. Video games are truly the means to greater expression right now and I want to fully embrace that.</p>

		<p>A couple of months ago I moved my blog from Tumblr over to Jekyll and started hosting it with Webfaction. It’s been great so far but, I never quite figured out how to get rid of my old url redirecting everything to it’s new page on the new blog.</p>

<p>I originally thought I’d have to write a redirect rule for each of the posts I kept on the new blog and then make the subdomain redirect to to the domain. Needless to say that it felt so annoying that I ended up not doing anything at all. Until now, that is. So here is how I fixed stuff! First of all, since I imported my Tumblr posts using the importer that comes with Jekyll, I had urls that looked like this:</p>

<p><code>
	http://martianwabbit.com/2011/04/04/4344642365.html
</code></p>

<p>I didn’t really change them, I thought that they having their old ID would be handy when I wanted to make the shift completely. This ended up being a good decision at the end.</p>

<p>So now, the only thing I needed to do was to redirect this:</p>

<p><code>
http://blog.martianwabbit.com/post/4344642365/justvector-social-icons-font
</code></p>

<p>to this:</p>

<p><code>
http://martianwabbit.com/2011/04/04/4344642365.html
</code></p>

<p>Which isn’t as straight-forward since, I have no way of knowing what the date might be, so I changed the permalink for imported posts to this:</p>

<p><code>
<pre>
— <br />
layout: post <br />
title: &quot;JustVector Social Icons Font&quot; <br />
permalink: /post/4344642365.html <br />
—
</pre>
</code></p>

<p>So I could just do a simple URL redirect. Now, all I needed to do was setup apache so it’d redirect the URLs as intended, that was probably the easiest part, a quick regex later I ended up with this:</p>

<p><code>
<pre>
RedirectMatch \/post\/([0-9]+)\/.* /post/$1.html
</pre>
</code></p>

<p>Which worked exactly as intended, now all I have to do, is wait for the DNS to finish propagating.</p>

		<p>I am not really that much of a designer. I’ve worked as one but, I’d never describe me as a “web designer”. I am simply not that good with designing things. I do have good taste though and, can tell good design apart from bad design. I also have a solid knowledge of design and UX in general which is enough for my day to day activities. At the end of the day, the only thing I know about design, is that good design should be easy to use. How easy? Well, my mother should be able to use it without having to ask for my help. I obviously know that not all mothers need help when it comes to computers (to be honest, mine can handle herself just fine without me) but, the point is, your design should be easy to use first, and nice-looking second. My mother should be able to use your application without having to think too hard. Users are lazy and they like being able to do stuff without thinking. Try as hard as possible to make it easy for them to not think.</p>

<p>I really like how simple interfaces are kind of trending these days. It really is great, simple design helps get the message through and allows users to interact more freely with the web. I’ve always gone with “minimalist” designs mostly because, it’s easier to get right when you are not that great of a designer and also because it’s easier for the user to interact with any application if they are only presented what they need at any given moment.</p>

<p>Are you sure you need that extra button? Would anyone apart from power users benefit from having this on the interface? Will this get the message through? Can we hide all of this complexity so they can find it if they need it but wont get in the way if they don’t?</p>

<p>Think about, simple design is awesome, <a href="http://www.sensible.com/dmmt.html">don’t make me think</a> and don’t make my mother ask me for help.</p>

				<a href="/2013/02/13/On-the-Importance-of-Vanilla-Javascript.html">On the Importance of Vanilla Javascript</a>

		<p>There’s a very simple reason why people don’t see the need to learn “vanilla” Javascript. Boilerplate code. When you are trying to create something simple and straight-forward Javascript loves getting in the way. Well, Javascript doesn’t actually like getting in the way, browsers do. This gets worse when you are trying to support different browser versions. So you have to write things using the current APIs available to you and then, add a whole abstraction layer just so you can fall-back to a workable solution that might be needed to support a particular browser version which happens to be pretty old but a bunch of your users still use.</p>

<p>So, there’s two ways to look at this, either you go with the approach that will support the most users and let the other’s suffer (or degrade gracefully, ideally). Or write a bunch of boilerplate code to support browsers. Luckily, the second option is actually viable. There’s a plethora of libraries other people have taken the time to write for you. These are great. They are well tested, cross-browser and are really easy to use.</p>

<p>The problem is that sometimes you have to add 9595 lines of codes just to do something as simple as <code>$(&quot;code&quot;).addClass(&quot;prettyPrint&quot;); </code>. This is were a bunch of people will appear out of nowhere and tell you to do it manually with “vanilla” Javascript. I am not against vanilla Javascript. I actually like writing stuff in Javascript without the aid of libraries but, this is mostly unreasonable. For example, adding the class takes jQuery 38 lines. Now, you might say something along the lines that jQuery is an extreme example but, I am sure that everything that can be taken out was already taken out. So, you might just go with jQuery and call it the day, after all going the vanilla way is only feasible when you know your audience and want to tailor directly to them or when you are strict on who you support and are pro graceful degradation. Of course, if you have a time constraint it becomes even more one sided.</p>

<p>I personally think that soon enough, we won’t need jQuery to do as much for us, with new browser APIs it gets increasingly easier to get things done with less. Things like querySelectors and CSS3 animations can go a long way when building a modern site. But, as long as we have money to be made and time to be saved and many browsers to be supported, going vanilla might not be a good option in most cases.</p>
