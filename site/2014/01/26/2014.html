	<time>January 26, 2014</time>
	<p>I know I am a little late doing the whole goal setting and year review thing but, this year I wanted to try something different. I wanted to see how January turned out before setting goals.</p>

<p>This year will be pretty exciting. I&#8217;ll continue working as a consultant as I have for the past couple of years. Invivo Link is doing some pretty cool things and I am happy to help them continue building their product. Over at <a href='http://www.2build.it'>2build.it</a>, we&#8217;re working with some pretty cool clients, building a variety of pretty cool things, hopefully the company will grow a whole lot this year.</p>

<p>I tend to decide what I&#8217;d like to learn more during the year. This year&#8217;s language is going to be Rust. I&#8217;ve fallen in love with it on the past couple of months and I&#8217;d like to start building more things with it as the language becomes more stable. Apart from Rust, this year I&#8217;ll be working with Objective-C a whole lot more. I don&#8217;t fully like the language yet but, I feel like it can be a valuable tool in my toolset. I&#8217;ll also continue working on bundle.js as it has become essential to a client&#8217;s project which, turns out to be a great way to further develop it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d also like to write more, I didn&#8217;t get to do it as much as I wanted to last year so I&#8217;ve adjusted my goal, I want to write at least, 12 posts during the year. I think this is a reasonable quantity and I hope I&#8217;ll be able to reach it. I&#8217;d also like to read more, my goal for that is at least 52 books. I am up to speed so far so I am pretty sure I can reach that.</p>

<p>Finally, I&#8217;d like a travel more this year, I am getting a little tired and burned out and I feel that it would help me to travel and see things.</p>

<p>I achieved most of the important goals from last year so, I am looking forward to a great year.</p>
