	<h1><a href="/2012/10/15/housekeeping.html">A little House Keeping</a></h1>
	<time>October 15, 2012</time>
	<p>Hello world! It&#8217;s that time of the year again where I am forced to do a little house keeping. My blog has been incredibly hideous for a couple of months now and I finally got the opportunity to do somethign about it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve redesigned it and, since apparently I am terrible at designing stuff I went with a very minimalistic approach. So my new blog is easier on the eyes, simpler and, will now become my homepage.</p>

<p>There isn&#8217;t much to it, I&#8217;ll be moving a couple of my old posts over to the new blog and I&#8217;ll do my best to start blogging at least twice a week. It&#8217;s actually harder said than done&#8230;</p>

<p>The blog runs on Jekyll now, mostly because it is hacker friendlier than tumblr and I love the idea of version controlled blogging. I will also remove comments from the blog since they distract me quite often. If anyone feels the need to tell me anything they are free to email me.</p>
