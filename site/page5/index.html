		<p><span>So for some mysterious and unknown reason I am selling a windows markdown editor. It’s called Mew, and you can get it for $8 at </span><a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/mew-windows-markdown-editor/924879">codecanyon</a><span>.</span></p>
<p>Mew, as you’d expect from a markdown editor is pretty simple. I built it for myself using C# and the awesome .net framework. I was basically forced into building it since, there wasn&#8217;t a nice markdown editor for windows available. I worked on polishing it for a couple of weeks and now here the end result:</p>
<p><a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/mew-windows-markdown-editor/924879"><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lvp53kpOSQ1qazvm1.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>It has built-in snippets, color themes and a live-preview, among other things.</p>
<p>I am fairly happy with the results. It provides a simple, yet customizable enviorment, it’s fast and really simple. I’ve tried to create an editor that doesn’t get in your way and that actually tries to help you. It was built for my needs so, these are addressed completely. I might add more features in future versions if anyone requests them since, I want it to be good editor for everyone.</p>
<p>I have a small list of things I’ve been considering to add so, we’ll see how that ends up working. Hopefully I’ll get somewhere with it and, even if it’s not a good seller, I did enjoy building it, working with C# is entertaining and pretty cool so, it made the whole process a nice experience. If I don&#8217;t make a single sale for a couple of months I&#8217;ll open-source it since, it&#8217;d mean there&#8217;s no commercial potential for it.</p>

  I am probably the most bored person I know. What I mean by this is, that I am almost never entertained. Most of the time, I&#8217;ll be doing something for some 5 minutes before my short attention span takes me elsewhere. This has stopped me from finishing a lot of personal projects in the past, losing a lot of cool things I built halfway through. 
</p>

<p>
  Since, I almost never finish my projects, I&#8217;ve decided to start publishing them. Hopefully, just knowing that others are looking at my code my motivate me to continue developing something. I&#8217;ve finally started using <a title="My Github Account" href="https://github.com/Seich">my Github account</a> to it&#8217;s fullest. I honestly doubt it&#8217;ll actually have a great effect on me but, any motivation I might get will prove useful. So, in conclusion, I&#8217;ll be releasing most of the stuff I do whenever I am bored on my Github account and I&#8217;ll be posting about it here, all in an attempt to keep me interested.
</p>

<h2>Introducing PHP Routs</h2>

<p>
  Let&#8217;s move on to my actual project. <a title="PHP Routs" href="http://routs.martianwabbit.com">Routs</a>, is a small PHP library built to handle URLs. Some background: I was playing with <a title="Ruby's Sinatra" href="htttp://www.sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a> the other day and, just by reading the documentation I fell in love with how it managed URL routes (I later discovered I wasn&#8217;t the only since, there are a bunch of projects written in PHP following it&#8217;s example). So, I decided I wanted to do the same in PHP but, in a very simple way which, would allow me to easily implement it into any project by including a single file.
</p>

<p>
  It turned out to be a lot easier than I expected. After deciding on the syntax I would like to use with plugin I made huge advances in just a couple of lines. This is what I have so far:
</p>

<p>
  Let&#8217;s say I am building an simple one page site for some guy named Bob. Since it&#8217;s so simple, I want to have as much as I can in a single page. Routs allow me to do something like this:
</p>

<pre>
<code data-language="php">
require 'routs.php';

Rout::get('home', 'homeFunction');

function homeFunction($params) {
  templateManager::Render('home.tpl', $params);
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>
  In this example I am using Routs to handle all get requests to example.com/home using the homeFunction() function. The part about the template manager is whatever method you&#8217;re using, I&#8217;ll be creating my own soonish. Now, I added a form to my html page and I want it to be handled on the same page. My routs handler changes into this:
</p>

<pre>
<code data-language="php">
require 'routs.php';

Rout::get('home', 'homeFunction');

function homeFunction($params) {
  templateManager::Render('home.tpl', $params);
}

Rout::post('home', function($params){
  mail(
    'seich@martianwabbit.awesome', 
    'Some Subject', 
    emailHandler::Render('mailTemplate.tpl', $params)
  );
});
</code>
</pre>

<p>
  Which handles the the submitted form and so on. Basically, the possibilities are endless! :D So yeah, that&#8217;s it, have fun with it, fork it, tell me why it sucks, etc.

		<p>I&#8217;ve been pretty bored lately, so I decided to redesign my <a target="_self" href="http://www.martianwabbit.com">site</a> and  found an awesome social icon set by Alex Peattie (<a href="http://www.alexpeattie.com/"><a href="http://www.alexpeattie.com">http://www.alexpeattie.com</a></a>) to go with the new design. The set is minimalistic and really cool! Unfortunately, I wasn&#8217;t as happy to work with it as I would have liked to mainly because, I couldn&#8217;t decide on what size I wanted the icons on the new site and thus, I found myself opening photoshop and resizing them far too often. I eventually, as you might have guessed by the post&#8217;s title, decided that such an icon set would make an awesome font. So, I created a font file which included most icons from the set* . This would allow me to embed the font and get nice icons which, I can resize and recolor with css.</p>
<p>I am very happy with the results, I&#8217;ll be updating it soon as I wanna get rid of some of the icons  I included and replace them for others that I might think are more useful. The whole icon set is huge. So I&#8217;ll keep all versions I make around just in case the icon you&#8217;re looking for is in one of them. The main ones (Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, etc.) will be on all versions of the set.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve created a @font-face kit using fontsquirrel. So it&#8217;s pretty much ready to be downloaded and used as it is right now. You can check out Alex&#8217;s demos right <a href="http://www.alexpeattie.com/projects/justvector_font/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The font is distributed under the same license as the icons, the <a href="http://artlibre.org/licence/lal/en">Free Art License</a> which, allows you to pretty much do anything you want with it. Read the license if you want details.</p>
<p><em>* I didn&#8217;t include all icons because, fonts have limited glyph spots available and I wanted to support as many keyboard layouts as possible by only including icons in common keys. For example, I didn&#8217;t use any of the accent keys I have access to because, I know most English keyboards wouldn&#8217;t support them. (I have a Spanish keyboard)</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cl.ly/2a2H3K0F1y423l182J0t">Download Font Kit</a></strong></p>
<h2>Update: V1.2</h2>
<p>I found the first font a little hard to navigate so, I created a second version in which icons are now arranged alphabetically (mostly) and empty spaces where no icons could go were filled in with additional icons. This font version has less glyphs than the first version because it only uses letters and numbers. If you need some of the additional icons you can use the first one.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://cl.ly/3M0P0t2D2V403M1P2x2G">Download Font Kit (v1.2)</a></strong></p>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<ul><li>When you use these icons add a text-shadow. It&#8217;ll make the images smoother. Something like: <code>text-shadow: 0 0 1px #000;</code> would do the trick.</li>
</ul>
