title: "Installing FlatCAM on Ubuntu"
---

So FlatCAM is an essential part of my PCB milling workflow and has become
increasingly difficult to install on the latest version of Ubuntu. Here's a
couple of notes on how I managed to get it running.

The first thing is to clone the repo:

```
git clone https://bitbucket.org/jpcgt/flatcam
```

Something I didn't notice at first is that there's a beta branch available, it
uses newer versions of pyqt which makes everything way easier.

```
git checkout origin/Beta
```

If you are on Ubuntu you can run `ubuntu_setup.sh` and should install pretty
much everything you need. I did hit a snag though, for whatever reason if I
tried installing the requirements, gdal would not compile and break. Turns out
it comes down to it not finding the correct headers. You can get around it by
installing it manually like this:

```
pip install gdal==3.0.4 --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-I/usr/include/gdal/"
```

You should use whatever version `gdal-config --version` prints out. You should
also update the `requirements.txt` so that the version of gdal is also the same
so that the rest of the dependencies install.

Once that's up you can run it with `python FlatCAM.py`.
