## Before The Pandemic

My exile started a bit before the pandemic got to Honduras. Towards the end of
the previous year (2019) I had a cancer scare. It turned out to be nothing but
I developed a lot of anxiety around my health because of it. I had become overly
weary of anything health related and hearing of this SARS-like desease that was
showing up everywhere didn't help. By that time everyone was a bit tired of my
shenanigans and when I asked everyone around me to prepare for it I
(understandably) was not taken very seriously.

Honduras is poor and I knew it wouldn't take much for it's system to collapse.
If even rich countries seem to be struggling it wouldn't really take much for
the same to happen here. I told my mother that if she wanted to visit she'd have
to do so before the first case was reported in Honduras. Once that happened I'd
pretty much lock myself up and isolate for however long it took. She came to
visit a couple of weeks before the first case, just in-case. It sounded like
masks and hand sanitizer would be the first thing to fly off the shelves so I
purchased some preemptively. I figured I was being overly dramatic but better
safe than sorry. Having basic things I could hold to would make my anxiety
easier to control I figured.

As the pandemic seemed to get closer I told everyone my plans of staying indoors
until it was under control, that it might be a bit long but hopefully not more
than a couple of months. The 8th of March, we had Arleth over for brunch, we
talked about the upcoming pandemic over coffee.

On 10th of March, 2020 the first two cases of covid were reported in
Honduras my lock down would begin two days later. The following day I dismissed
the house staff, had them take the day off and go purchase groceries and supplies.
I assured them that they would still receive their salaries and that they would
have job once this was over.

## The first month

Once the first cases were reported everything started moving too fast. By Sunday
every supermarket was swamped with people and supplies started dwindling. I felt
a bit validated knowing I had prepared myself with a couple months worth of
food. That sense of validation didn't really last long.

For the first couple of weeks everything was under strict lockdown and looked
like Honduras wouldn't spiral too bad. Wishful thinking.

The 20th we had a nice break with the release of Animal Crossing: New Horizons.
It came in at the best time, the boredom was settling in and everyone with a
switch was playing it. It felt like a community event, everyone was alone,
playing together. It carried us over a month or two.

By the end of march the food was a little less varied so it seemed like the
right time to resupply. It looked like all supermarkets were booked for
deliveries for a month or so in advanced so we had to get creative. For
non-perishable we used a small supermarket that specialized in organic goods.
It's variety wasn't great and it was really expensive but it allowed us to get
some basics and some not-so-basics while the regular supermarkets got their act
together.

Mid April everything got a lot better. We found a local catering company that
being unable to cater, had started selling vegetables, dairy and eggs. Getting
fresh vegetables for the first time after almost two months gave me back my will
to live.

    We are about 4 weeks away from being fully immunized which is as far as I
    know, the closest thing to an end there can be for the time being.
