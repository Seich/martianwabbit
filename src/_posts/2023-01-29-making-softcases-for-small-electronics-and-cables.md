title: "Making Softcases for Small Electronics and Cables"
---

Wraps are my favorite way of storing small electronics. Whenever I get a new one
I'll probably make one really quickly to store it and it's accessories.

It's a fairly straightforward process. Start with a piece of cloth. I really
like this one, where it's like felt on one side and like linen on the other. It
makes it so the interior is really nice and soft.

I'll start by measuring the device I'll be wrapping. Once I've got the
measurements I'll lay my cloth on the floor and draw a rough rectangle. It'll be
a bit wider than needed and about four times the length of the device. This will
let me wrap it comfortably a couple of times.

I'll then cut this rectangle off.

I'll then fold a third of this cloth on top of itself and sew it. I got a free
sewing machine a while back (all it took was a couple of 3d printed replacement
parts to get it working but that's a story for another day) which I use for
this.

Once that's done I'll flip it inside-out and sew any open borders to give it a
cleaner look.

I'll also sew a elastic on the open side so I can close it up.

I am not great a sewing.

I'll then place the device inside, wrap it up and figure out where to put a
button so that it closes up cleanly.

Buttons are hard. I'll do as many passes as possible because I really suck at
place them. Just doing a lot of passes will usually yield a nice looking result.

It's all about confidence. Once it's all done, you can insert the device in and
wrap it, using the elastic as a latch.
