title: "PocketChip in 2020"
---

After many years of wanting one and then giving up on them when the company went
under, I finally acquired a PocketChip. This thing is great. Not all around
great but great _in principle_. It has a great form factor with a nice screen
and great battery life. I quite like it. I've been using it to control my
plotters wirelessly, for counting words on my typewriter and to backup my op-z.
I've ran into a bunch of issues along the way so here are my notes on it, what's
worked and what hasn't in case someone else wants to give it a go.

## Apt Sources

The first thing you should do is change you apt sources. It turns out when the
NextThingCo went under they took their mirrors with them (naturally). Luckily a
valuable member of the community took the time to create a mirror for it we can
all use [here](http://chip.jfpossibilities.com/chip/debian/). That same member
of the community also took the time to mirror all of NextThingCo's repositories
and other goodies:
[http://chip.jfpossibilities.com/](http://chip.jfpossibilities.com/) this is in
general the single best resource of data and code available for the chip in
2020.

I ran into an issue with Jessie backports, as the distribution is pretty old
it'll be necessary to update your apt sources to use the debian archive mirror:

```sh
deb http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main
deb-src http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main

deb http://archive.debian.org/debian/ jessie-backports main
deb-src http://archive.debian.org/debian/ jessie-backports main

deb http://archive.debian.org/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free
deb-src http://archive.debian.org/debian/ jessie main contrib non-free
```

Don't forget to disable validity checks:

```sh
echo "Acquire::Check-Valid-Until false;" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10-nocheckvalid
```

## SSH Access

The PocketChip doesn't include an ssh server by default so I'd recommend
installing one once you've gotten your apt updating and running:

```sh
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
```

## Checking the Battery Level

There's two magic files in the os that reflect your current battery state, you
can use `/usr/lib/pocketchip-batt/voltage` to check how charged your PocketChip
is and you can use `/usr/lib/pocketchip-batt/charging` to check if it's charging
or not. These are mostly useful for scripts and such.

The voltage range is from `3600` to `4200` from what I've seen.

## Using UART

If you want to use the built-in UART you need to shutdown getty:

```sh
sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyS0.service
```

You can then use `/dev/ttyS0` as you normally would as a terminal or programmer
and `stty` to check the config `stty -F /dev/ttyS0` or change it
`stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 9600`.

## A full desktop environment

If you want to have a full desktop environment running on your chip, you can use
[PocketDesk](https://github.com/AllGray/PocketDesk), which sets it up for you.

## Using your GPIO Pins

This actually took a lot of tinkering and was going to be the original focus of
this blog post.

PocketOS provides an easy way (once you figure it out) to enable or disable gpio
pins. Under `/sys/class/gpio` there's two sinks `export` and `unexport`. As
`root` you can use `export` to enable a gpio pin by piping it the pin's
identifier:

```sh
echo 1015 > /sys/class/gpio/export
```

Apparently these identifiers changed depending on the OS version, on mine it
starts with GPIO 1 as `1015` and follows with GPIO 2 on `1016` and so on. When
you are done using a pin you should `unexport` it:

```sh
echo 1015 > /sys/class/gpio/unexport
```

While the pin is exported you can set three settings according to what you are
trying to achieve:

1. Pin direction:

```sh
echo "in" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio1015/direction
echo "out" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio1015/direction
```

2. Active Low:

```sh
echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio1015/active_low
echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio1015/active_low
```

3. Edge detection:

```sh
echo "rising" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio1015/edge
echo "falling" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio1015/edge
echo "none" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio1015/edge
```

You can check the GPIO's state by reading the value:

```sh
cat /sys/class/gpio/gpio1015/value
# Either 0 or 1 depending on the current state of the pin.
```

Since this behaves like a normal file and emits events you can use anything that
uses inotify to watch it. For example, here's how you'd monitor a button press
using inotify-hookable:

```sh
cd /sys/class/gpio
echo 1015 > export
cd gpio1015

echo 0 > active_low
echo "in" > direction
echo "rising" > edge

inotify-hookable -f ./value -c "cat ./value"
```

There's some extra information about the pins in the
[community wiki](http://web.archive.org/web/20210222094348/http://www.chip-community.org/index.php/GPIO_Info).
The pin numbers seem wrong for the pocketchip but the rest of the information
available seems solid.

## Configure the app launcher

The default built-in launcher for the PocketChip, PocketHome, can be minimally
configured by editing a json file `/usr/share/pocket-home/config.json`. You can
change the apps and the icons from there among other small niceties.

I'd recommend changing the terminal to xfce-terminal, it comes pre-installed and
seems to be better in general, I changed the terminal button to this:

```json
{
  "name": "Terminal",
  "shell": "xfce-terminal --hide-borders --fullscreen --hide-menubar",
  "icon": "appIcons/terminal.png"
}
```

You need to restart the entire PocketChip for the changes to kick in.

Also, if you are ever using a keyboard, dmenu is installed and mapped to alt +
space which is super nice for quickly switching apps.

And that's it, I think, everything I've had to figure out about the PocketChip,
distilled into one blog post. Let me know if there's anything important you
think I should know.
