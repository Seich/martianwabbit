I was lucky enough to be gifted an old, broken guitar.

It was in pretty rough shape. The bridge had been bolted to the body so when it started lifting it broke through the top.

I felt that it wasn't really worth restoring it and that I'd rather try building something new on top of it. I was thinking that just adding a pickup would make it a bit more interesting.

I started by removing half of the top. Since I don't care too much about the quality, I was able to remove the lower half quite easily with a utility knife.

I used this lower half to create a template to create a new lower half.

I used this template to cut a thin sheet of plywood to replace that piece. It's a bit oversized but I will be sanding it down to size.

The new plywood was a bit thicker than the rest of the top so I had to plane the outer wall down so that both parts would be somewhat flush together.
