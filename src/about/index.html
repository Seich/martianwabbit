		Sergio Díaz is an Honduran Developer who particularly loves the web. He has a cat name Glitch who seems to hate him for no apparent reason. In his free time he likes playing with arduinos, reading and listening to music (sometimes all at the same time).
		He also enjoys writing and talking about himself in third person for some weird reason.

	<p>He is currently a partner at <a href="http://www.2build.it">2build.it</a> and works as a developer for <a href="http://invivolink.com">InVivoLink</a>.</p>
